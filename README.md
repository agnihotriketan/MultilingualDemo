Globalization is the process of preparing your site so that it is accessible to as wide an audience as possible.

ASP.NET already provides a localization framework, which is based on Cultures and Resources. Web Pages have a Culture property and a UICulture property. 

you have one resource file which represents the default culture for the site. You need additional resource files for other languages. These need to be named carefully, as the framework expects to find valid culture codes as part of the file name.
